# "Pseudo-3D" Orthogonal Top-Down Game Demo

A small demo of an orthogonal 2D game that "fakes" a Z-axis to allow for 3D platforming, ala the *Mario & Luigi* RPG series.
Runs entirely in Godot's 2D engine -- collisions are calculated in 3D, then the results are transposed to 2D to be drawn by the engine.

To run, load the project into Godot (https://godotengine.org/download/ - standard 64-bit version is sufficient) and press Play (F5). WASD/arrow keys to move, space to jump.
